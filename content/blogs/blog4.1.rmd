Originally from Chicago, Lindsey Zastawny is currently reading for a Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. An active member of the LBS community, Lindsey serves as a Student Ambassador for the MFA program, is the VP of Sailing - Cruising for the Sailing Club, and is on the Community & Social team for Women in Business. As a Student Ambassador, Lindsey represents the school and interacts with potential applicants. Within her roles on the Sailing Club and Women in Business, Lindsey helps in planning the cruising trek and the Equality Ball, respectively. 

This past spring, Lindsey graduated *summa cum laude* with honors from the University of Georgia, where she obtained a B.B.A. in Finance and completed a Sustainability Certificate.

While at UGA, Lindsey was heavily involved in the club sailing team, as well as Alpha Phi Fraternity, Counterpoint Dance Company, and Women in Finance.

This past summer before coming to LBS, Lindsey interned in the leveraged finance group at Aegon Asset Management. During this 11-week internship, she completed rotations through various groups including High Yield, Emerging Markets, Private Equity, and Distressed/Special Sits. The projects she completed revolved mainly around research, data analysis, and ESG policy. After graduation, Lindsey plans to work within investment research or capital markets.
