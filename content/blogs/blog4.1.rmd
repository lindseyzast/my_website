Originally from Chicago, Lindsey Zastawny is currently reading for a Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. An active member of the LBS community, Lindsey serves as a Student Ambassador for the MFA program, is the VP of Sailing - Cruising for the Sailing Club, and is on the Community & Social team for Women in Business. As a Student Ambassador, Lindsey represents the school and interacts with potential applicants. Within her roles on the Sailing Club and Women in Business, Lindsey helps in planning the cruising trek and the Equality Ball, respectively. 

This past spring, Lindsey graduated *summa cum laude* with honors from the University of Georgia, where she obtained a B.B.A. in Finance and completed a Sustainability Certificate.
